  <dt>Reading Books:</dt>
  <dd>- I enjoy reading because it lets me experience new stories and explore different worlds. It helps me understand the world better by offering diverse perspectives, broadening my view of life.Additinally it enriches vocabulary and helps to use language efficiently.</dd>
  <dt>Listening to Musics:</dt>
      <dd>- I listen to music on side when i am busy with some task. IT might be studying and chores or even working out. It helps me to stay concentrated and keeps me fun. It is also about culture as some songs migt have a very deeply rooted story so we can learn about them.</dd>  
  <dt> Learning Languages: </dt>
       <dd>-Currently I am Learnig German and it is so much fun for me. Some people find it chellenging to learn new vocabulary, grasp the chellanging grammar and be able to use it.But for me, it is very easy and exiting.I like how it gives us chance to discover a completely new world.   </dd>
